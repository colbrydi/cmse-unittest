# CMSE-UnitTest
Written by Dirk Colbry 

This is a simple framework so we can run unittests on a new or upgraded system and try to verify if packages are installed and ready for CMSE courses.  This is intended mostly for student's who want to try and debug problems they may be having on their system.
